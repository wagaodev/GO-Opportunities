## Description

This project is an API developed in Golang that allows you to search for job listings based on programming language, level of seniority, and salary. It enables both retrieval of information and registration of new job opportunities.

## How to Run the Project üèÉ

To run this Golang project, you'll need to have Go installed on your system. If you don't have it yet, please follow the [official Go installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Once Go is installed, you can execute the project in the following ways:

### Using Makefile üìÑ

We have included a Makefile that simplifies the process of building, running, testing, and cleaning up the project. Here are some commands you can use:

- **Run the application**: `make run`  
   This command compiles and executes the main program.

- **Build the application**: `make build`  
   Compiles the application and generates an executable file named after the `APP_NAME` variable in the Makefile.

- **Run tests**: `make test`  
   Executes all the tests in the project.

- **Generate documentation**: `make docs`  
   Generates project documentation.

- **Clean up**: `make clean`  
   Removes all generated files, including the application executable and documentation.

For more details, refer to the Makefile in the project directory.
